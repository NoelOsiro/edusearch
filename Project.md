## Problem Definition: Navigating the Maze of School Selection in Kenya

Choosing the right school is a critical decision for a child's future, but in Kenya, the process is fraught with challenges. The lack of transparency and centralized information makes it difficult for parents, guardians, and students to make informed decisions. Existing resources like individual school websites, unofficial rankings, and word-of-mouth are often unreliable, inconsistent, or biased. The government's placement process, while helpful, provides only basic details such as location, without addressing crucial aspects like curriculum or teacher qualifications.

### Consequences

- **Inefficient Search:** Gathering information from scattered sources is time-consuming and overwhelming.
- **Unsatisfactory Matches:** Students may end up in schools that don't align with their needs, leading to disengagement and underachievement.
- **Parental Stress and Anxiety:** The lack of transparent information creates stress and anxiety for parents.

## Proposed Solution

### Comprehensive School Database

EDUSEARCH will provide a centralized platform that houses a comprehensive database of schools across all levels in Kenya (primary, secondary, university, college, TVET).

### Standardized Information

Each school profile will include standardized information to facilitate easy comparison:

- Brief description and history of the school
- High-quality images showcasing the school environment
- Academic performance data (overall results, past achievements, standardized test scores if available)
- Location and details on the school system (public, private, religious affiliation)
- Availability of vacancies and general school fee structure
- Listing of extracurricular activities offered
- Amenities and facilities available (libraries, science labs, sports facilities, etc.)
- Verifiable contact information for the school
- User-generated reviews and ratings (with a moderation system to ensure accuracy)

### Advanced Search and Comparison Tools

- **Search:** Users can find schools based on specific criteria such as location, level, school system, or keywords (e.g., STEM programs, language focus).
- **Comparison:** Tools to compare schools side-by-side based on user-defined preferences (e.g., fees, extracurricular activities, facilities).

### Benefits and Impact

- **Empowering Informed Decisions:** A central repository of transparent and standardized information enables parents, guardians, and students to make informed school choices that align with individual needs and preferences.
- **Enhanced Search Efficiency:** Advanced tools streamline the search process, saving valuable time.
- **Improved School-Student Match:** Access to comprehensive and accurate information leads to better school-student matches, fostering student engagement and academic success.
- **Promoting Transparency and Accountability:** Encourages schools to provide accurate information, thereby promoting transparency and accountability within the education system.

## Value Proposition

EDUSEARCH aims to help students and parents find the most suitable school by offering:

- **Personalized Filters:** Users can filter schools based on specific interests and needs, such as sports, drama festivals, or top achievers.
- **Insightful Reviews:** Reviews from alumni, administration, parents, and teachers provide valuable insights, revealing hidden information about schools.
- **Reliable Connections:** Verified contact information facilitates easy and reliable networking between parents and schools.

## Monetization

To sustain and generate revenue, EDUSEARCH will explore the following strategies:

1. **Featured Listings:** Schools can pay to be featured on the homepage or have highlighted profiles.
2. **Premium User Experience:** Users can pay for a premium experience that includes personalized school recommendations based on specific preferences and access to exclusive content such as articles from schools.
3. **Google Ad Revenue:** Leveraging ad placements to generate additional income.
